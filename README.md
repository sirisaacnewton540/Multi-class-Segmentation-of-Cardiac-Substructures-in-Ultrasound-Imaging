# 🫀 Deep Learning for Left Ventricular Function Assessment in 2D Echocardiography

**CAMUS Dataset-Based Segmentation and Ejection Fraction Prediction Framework**

---

## 📚 Background and Medical Context

**Cardiovascular disease (CVD)** is the leading cause of death worldwide. One of the most critical indicators of cardiac health is the **Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF)**—a percentage that quantifies how much blood the left ventricle ejects during each contraction. LVEF is routinely used to:

* Diagnose **heart failure**, cardiomyopathies, and valvular disorders
* Monitor patients undergoing cardiac treatments
* Stratify risk in acute coronary syndromes

The **Simpson’s biplane method**, recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE), estimates LVEF using volumetric assessments from two orthogonal views: apical 4-chamber (A4C) and apical 2-chamber (A2C). This requires accurate tracing of the **endocardial boundary** at **end-diastole (ED)** and **end-systole (ES)**—a task prone to intra-observer and inter-observer variability.

Manual contouring is time-consuming and skill-intensive. Automating this using **deep learning** addresses both the workload and reproducibility challenges while opening the door to **scalable, AI-driven cardiac diagnostics**.

## 🧠 Theoretical Foundations

This project is rooted in three core concepts:

### 1. **Image Segmentation in Medical Imaging**

Semantic segmentation assigns a class label to each pixel in an image. In echocardiography, this translates to delineating the **LV endocardium** and **epicardium**, which are critical for volume computation. We use **U-Net**, a convolutional encoder–decoder architecture known for its efficiency in low-data medical domains due to skip connections preserving spatial resolution.

### 2. **Simpson’s Biplane Method of Discs**

The Simpson’s method estimates LV volume by slicing the ventricle into elliptical discs, then summing their volumes:

$$
V = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot d_i^2 \cdot h
$$

where $d_i$ is the diameter of each disc, and $h$ is the height. This requires accurate tracing of the long axis and cross-sectional widths in both A4C and A2C planes.

Ejection Fraction is computed as:

$$
EF = \frac{V_{ED} - V_{ES}}{V_{ED}} \times 100
$$

### 3. **Clinical Interpretability and Robustness**

In real-world practice, a model's utility is defined not just by accuracy, but by **interpretability** and **trust under uncertainty**. We emphasize:

* Validation on pathological and low-quality cases
* Frame-wise vs sequence-wise segmentation
* Dice + MAE in EF as dual evaluation metrics

---

## 🎯 Research Hypothesis and Contribution

> **Hypothesis:** A deep learning model trained on heterogeneously curated echocardiographic data can approximate expert-level segmentation and deliver clinically usable ejection fraction estimates, even under variability in image quality and pathological conditions.

**This project contributes:**

* A **U-Net based segmentation model** for ED/ES phases in both A4C and A2C views
* An **end-to-end LVEF estimation pipeline** using predicted masks and Simpson’s rule
* A real-world evaluation on **heterogeneous and partially pathological data** from the CAMUS dataset
* Discussion on performance drop with poor quality and insight into model interpretability

## 🔬 Research Questions

1. Can a U-Net-based model generalize to noisy and clinically realistic echocardiography images?
2. How does segmentation accuracy vary across views and cardiac phases?
3. Can LVEF derived from automated segmentations stay within clinical tolerance (±5%)?
4. What is the impact of low-quality frames and pathologies on segmentation robustness?

## 🔍 Interpretation

* **High Dice scores** show strong agreement with expert contours, even under real-world constraints.
* **EF MAE < 5%** aligns with the clinically acceptable variability range.
* Errors tend to rise in **A2C** and **poor-quality cases**, likely due to probe misalignment and shadowing artifacts.
* No significant model failure on any subgroup, suggesting generalizability.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* EF estimation assumes **perfect A4C–A2C alignment**, which might not hold in all patients.
* No longitudinal modeling across frames—motion artifacts not captured.
* Ground truth limited to one expert—no inter-rater variability measured.

---

## 🔮 Future Work

* Integrate **temporal tracking** for motion-aware segmentation
* Add **explainability maps** for boundary uncertainty
* Extend to **multimodal fusion** with ECG or clinical metadata
* Apply **domain adaptation** for external validation on new hospitals
